## Reporting a Vulnerability

Due to their sensitive nature, security vulnerabilities should be reported directly to ProKnow. To privately report a vulnerability, please email [ProKnow Support](mailto:proknowsupport@elekta.com). After submitting a vulnerability, the ProKnow team will keep you updated with the status of its fix.

Be sure to include as much detail as possible about the nature of the vulnerability, how severe and how to reproduce.
